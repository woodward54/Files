## Earthack 2017

A hackathon is a competition in which teams are given 36 hours to build/code a project on site. We did just that. Before this competition, we had all only seen each other passing by in hallways at UNT, but we left a team. Together we came up with the idea of a C02 sensing drone that we could control autonomously and collect data around Dallas. Dallas currently has two stationary CO2 sensors that are in charge of the city as a whole. We wanted to implement a way that exact locations of high emissions could be found. 

Within the 36 hours, we built and programmed the drone and sensor systems. We ended up getting through the first round and presenting in the finals. We placed third overall with our invention, but that was not enough. We began to improve and refine our idea with the help of Michael Dwinnell; turning it into a marketable service hence Aerium Solutions!

## Improvements since Earthack

Since Earthack, we have stepped up our game. No longer is this a project, but our baby. 

Our drone has autonomous flight via bluetooth, real-time updating of data collection, live video streaming, and more! It is adabtable and expandable to fit almost any needs. We plan on continuing to improve and help the Earth cut down on emissions.
