<center>Aerium Solutions is a team dedicated to UAV data collection and reporting.</center>
<center>You call, we fly! </center>

## What we do
Our drone has sensors to fit any need!

Currently, we are focusing on CO2 emissions.

Because of our design, we collect a large amount of information simultaneously. This allows us to take accurate gas measurements of multiple types, temperature, gps lcoation, video, and more.

The data is mapped on your secure account in real-time so you will always have access.
